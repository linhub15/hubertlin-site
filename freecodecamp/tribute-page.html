        <p>
            In the game of Dota2 magical abilities rule the battlefield.
            Each hero has a unique set of spells that can be used to bring the battle into your favor.
            Invoker is the only hero with 10 unique abilities.
            The abilities are created by combinig three energy types: Quas, Wex and Exort.
            Three Quas energies makes the cold-snap ability, while three Exort energies make the Sun Strike ability.
            With up to ten combinations of spells it is easy to see why this hero is so strong.
        </p>

        <p>
            With so many strengths also come a few limitations. This hero is limited to only holding 2 spells at a time.
            Once invoked, a spell will be ready to be casted but upon invoking a third spell when 2 spells have already been invoked,
            the spell that was invoked first will be lost until invoked again.
            Also Invoker's abilities have much higher cost than other abilities. Both in terms of cool down (the time you wait to cast the spell again),
            and mana (a type of energy that is consumed when casting spells).
        </p>

        <p>
            With so much to learn, Invoker is one of the highest skill heroes to play in the game, but also one of the most rewarding.
