Black Friday just passed and I'm sure there have been plenty of large TV and computer monitor purchases. I'll be holding off for the ultra wide screen monitors to come down in price a little more before get one for myself.&nbsp;

With our monitors getting wider and wider, do we still need maximum line lengths in our code?&nbsp;

## My answer is yes.

I don't just mean there needs to be maximum line lengths in our code, but I'm crazy enough to suggest this should be implemented in all areas of a modern workplace.&nbsp;

* Emails
* Wiki pages
* Word documents

## Why?

Let me answer that with a question to you. What's easier to read?

\*\*\* LONG STRING OF TEXT IN AN EMAIL \*\*\*

Short email broken up

&nbsp;

\*\*\* LONG STRING OF TEXT FOR CODE \*\*\*

Broken up code&nbsp;

&nbsp;

I believe that if we can reduce the line lengths of our documents, we can make our lives a little easier at work. Who knows, maybe your boss might notice you put thought into your email presentation and give you points for **attention to detail**.
