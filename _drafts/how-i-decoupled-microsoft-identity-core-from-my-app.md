title: How I Decoupled Microsoft Identity Core from my App

During my quest to make my architecture clean there was a huge dependency that needed to be inverted. Many web applications require authentication, so it seems natural to depend on an authentication framework. In order to follow the guidelines of clean architecture, it was important that my application's core did not depend on frameworks.

The project layout follows this structure:
{: .present-before-paste}

1. Core - Core Business details, does not depend on anything but itself
2. Infrastructure - Implements and depends on core interfaces
3. API - UI layer that depends on Infrastructure and Core

## Steps to Decouple

#### 1. Define authentication methods

We need to ***register*** and ***sign in*** a user. I didn't include a ***sign out*** because I will be using JSON Web tokens and they will have a short expiry date. It's&nbsp;<u>not secure</u> so don't do this in a real application.

#### 2. Define User Class
{: .present-before-paste}

Next, we'll need to define the&nbsp;**User&nbsp;**object that we're passing into Register. In my case I only have 3 fields. User name, email, and password.

That's it for the Core.

#### 3. Implement IAuthenticator in Infrastructure
{: .present-before-paste}

In the infrastructure layer, we create an Authenticator to implement the IAuthenticator interface. This is where we include dependencies on Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity as well as all other dependencies we will be using.

* Use dependency injection for any required objects / services / managersâ€¦ etc
* Include helper method to generate JSON Web Token

```csharp
public class Authenticator : IAuthenticator
{
    private readonly MyDbContext _context;
    private readonly UserManager<IdentityUser> _userManager;
    private readonly SignInManager<IdentityUser> _signInManager;

    public Authenticator(
        MyDbContext context,
        UserManager<IdentityUser> userManager,
        SignInManager<IdentityUser> signInManager)
    {
        _context = context;
        _userManager = userManager;
        _signInManager = signInManager;
    }
    private string GenerateJwt(string userName, IdentityUser user)
    {
        var claims = new List<Claim>
        {
            new Claim(JwtRegisteredClaimNames.Sub, userName),
            new Claim(JwtRegisteredClaimNames.Jti, Guid.NewGuid().ToString()),
            new Claim(ClaimTypes.NameIdentifier, user.Id)
        };

        var key = new SymmetricSecurityKey(
            Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes("someRandomKey123abc"));

        var creds = new SigningCredentials(
            key, SecurityAlgorithms.HmacSha256);

        var expires = DateTime.Now.AddDays(1);

        var token = new JwtSecurityToken(
            "JwtIssuer",
            "JwtIssuer",
            claims,
            expires: expires,
            signingCredentials: creds
        );
        return new JwtSecurityTokenHandler().WriteToken(token);
    }
}
```
