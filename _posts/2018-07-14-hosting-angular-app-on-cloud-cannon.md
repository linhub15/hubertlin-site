# {{ page.title }}

I've been using Cloud Cannon Hosting for Jekyll static generated websites for a few months now. When I finally started learning about Angular it seemed like both would play well since they are both served from static resources. I was wrong.

As it turns out, Angular apps are meant for "Single Page Applications" so they are literally one page. The index.html page. So when I try to use Angular Router and go to www.example.com/ComponentPage I get a 404 resource not found.

The Cloud Cannon servers are taking the browser request literally and trying to find that resource on the server, but since it's an Angular app, there really isn't anything there. So what options do I have?

I could use the hashtag routing, but the Angular docs consider that old-school and strongly recommend sticking the the HTML5 URLs for cleaner easier to read URLs. I even considered messaging Cloud Cannon to ask if they could add a feature to redirect all 404 errors to the index.html page. But…

After looking around at the Angular documentation at the very bottom of the deployment page there is a section about deploying to Github Pages. To my surprise I found the solution!

## The Solution

Create a 404.html page and copy the contents of index.html into that page. Cloud Cannon servers will automatically direct the 404 errors to the 404.html page which will naturally trigger the Angular Routing Module.

1. Create an empty 404.html page in /src/ directory
2. Add "404.html" to the "projects/[your-app]/architect/build/options/assets" array found in the src/angular.json file
3. <code>ng build –-prod</code>
4. Copy the contents of the /dist/index.html into /dist/404.html
5. git commit / git push

The most important step is to make sure that the 404.html contents match index.html exactly. Since each ng-build changes the file hashes and references in index.html this must be done to ensure routing works.

## For now…

This isn't the best solution, but for now I'm really happy with Cloud Cannon Hosting. It would be nice to have a way to use the amazing features of Angular and somehow merge it with Jekyll static sites.
